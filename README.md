Re-imbersement Tickets

Project Description

The system maintains a master product list and monitors inventory levels for each product. To monitor inbound and outbound logistics, 
the system provides services for other applications to increment and decrement inventory levels. The interface allows users to perform 
periodic inventory counts. Reporting and analysis tools compare ideal inventory levels against actual levels, support demand planning 
activities, and monitor profitability. Managers can set thresholds for safety stock, and the system will email the appropriate contact 
when a product falls below the threshold.
